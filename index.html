            <p>
                James A. Gosling, O.C , Ph.D. (born May 19, 1955 near Calgary, Alberta, Canada)
                 is a famous software developer,
                 best known as the father of the Java programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently James Gosling is Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.
              
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 1984 and 2010, Gosling was with Sun Microsystems. He created the original design of Java in 1994 and implemented the language’s original compiler and virtual machine. 
                In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.

            <p>
                James Gosling is considered the father of Java, the programming language we all know and (questionably) love. After receiving his Bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Calgary, Gosling obtained his Masters and PhD in the subject at Carnegie Mellon University. He began work at Sun Microsystems upon completion of his PhD. One day while working there, Gosling encountered a problem when he needed to write a program to translate software code from one language to another. Seeing the inherent problem with this, Gosling set out to create a programming language that could be written once and run anywhere (with the help of a few others, such as Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton). Thus, Java (and the JVM) was born!
